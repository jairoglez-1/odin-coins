    <h1><strong>What is al pastor</strong></h1>
    <p>Al pastor is a Mexican dish with pork that`s been slow roasted on a vertical spit. Vertical spits are often associated with 
        middle eastern food and this is no exception. 
        Legend says that Lebanese immigrants brought the cooking method to Mexico, where they paired it with traditional adobada 
        to make the genius style known as al pastor.
        </p>

    <p>It`s served in all kinds of dishes, from tortas/sandwiches, to pizzas, and even on rice, but the most celebrated way to 
        serve it is in tacos al pastor. The crisp smoky 
        pork is sliced-to-order with a razor sharp knife as it`s flame crisped by the vertical spit. The meat falls right 
        into each taco and topped with a flourish of slow-roasted pineapple. It`s heaven in a tiny tortilla.

            Soak the guajillos in a small bowl filled with hot tap water for 15 mins. You can either remove the stems and seeds beforehand,
            or wait til the peppers are soft and pliable, hold them by the tip, upside down, over the sink, and cut the stems off. The seeds should fall right out.
