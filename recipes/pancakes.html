    <h2><strong>Classic Pancakes</strong></h2>
    <p>
        This classic pancake recipe has appeared in every Betty Crocker cookbook since 1950.
        Pancakes are a breakfast tradition and are so easy to make. Our pancakes from scratch calls for regular milk, 
        but we also give a variation to use buttermilk. Top either version with maple syrup or fresh fruit. Be sure to try our new twist, 
        made with cornmeal, they`re hearty and have a delicious buttery syrup on top.

    <h2><strong>Recipe</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 cup of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>3 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil or melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In medium bowl, beat egg with wire whisk until fluffy. Stir in remaining ingredients just until flour is moistened 
            (batter will be slightly lumpy); do not overmix or pancakes will be tough.
            For thinner pancakes, stir in additional 1 to 2 tablespoons milk. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375Â°F). (To test griddle, sprinkle with a few drops of water. If bubbles jump around,
            heat is just right.) Brush with vegetable oil if necessary (or spray with cooking spray before heating). 
        </li>
        <li>
            For each pancake, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly on top and dry around edges. 
            Turn; cook other side until golden brown. 
        </li>
    </ol>
